- the idea of [[magic forest]] adopted to a highlands of [[cyber valley]]
- criteria for species selection
	- [[adopted]]: known to be productive, hardy and low maintenance
	- [[scalable]]: they are easy to propagate
	- [[high margin]]: together cover need for [[food]] system
- key idea behind highland magic
	- you are not producing and selling one successful crop
	- but you are producing full menu to serve in your family restaurant
	- here are several examples
		- you sell coffee for $0.8 per kg, however you can earn $300 if cooked and sold by cups
		- you sell taro, batat and casava for $0.5 per kg, however you can earn $100 if cooked and sold by chips
		- you sell avocado for $0.8 per kg, however it costs $30 being sold as salad
	- main problem with cloth: you will always depend on the cigaretes market
	- currently you sell your crops for $1-2 per kg, however you can earn at least $50 if served as lunch
	- there is a huge demand from tourism on the non toxic, natural food they can see how its being grown
	- the approach allow you to become more resilient agains crop failures and market fluctuations
	- and rise margin of your farm significantly
	- but to switch you must shift your mind from mono culture to poly culture food systems
	- this include plants, animal, fungi and aquatics
	- altogether the produce reliable and abundant system
