- ## Intro
  collapsed:: true
	- > fire can destroy life — or create it
	- key promise: how heat transforms waste into fertility and energy simultaneously
- ## Terra Pretta
  collapsed:: true
	- the amazonians: pre-columbian people building “dark earths” along the amazon basin
	- archaeological context: fertile patches surrounded by poor lateritic soil
	- composition: charcoal fragments, pottery shards, bones, plant residues
	- lasting fertility: stable carbon, microbial richness, nutrient retention for milenia (8000 years - 500 years ago)

	- mystery solved: char as the foundation — the biochar effect

- ## Science of Biochar
  collapsed:: true
	- basics of pyrolysis
		- input: biomas
		- drying is important
		- pyrolysis: 200c - 400c + no oxygen → devolatilization → carbonization
		- activation + inoculation
		- output: heat, biogas + bio-oil, biochar
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1761742187874_0.png)
	- difference between ash, charcoal and biochar
		- the balance between carbon yield and energy recovery
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1761742823407_0.png)
		- charcoal is carbon made for fire
		- biochar is carbon made for life
	- in the soil
		- physical structure: porous carbon matrix as habitat for microbes
		- chemical role: cation exchange, pH buffering, nutrient storage
		- biological synergy: microbe housing + water retention + reduced leaching

- ## How to produce?
	- fast start: kontiki kiln

		- no smoke: {{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o0QqePtNM4}}
	- how much I need?
		- 370 000 m2 => top 30 cm
		- $1 - $20 per kg
		- current bioavailable carbon: 3%
		- target for chernozem level: 12%
		- 370000000 kg of soil * 0.09 * 0.5 = ~20 mil kg
		- # => $20M - $200M
	- scaled: too big - requires >10 km2 of forest to feed
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1761744124257_0.png)
	- quite good designs, but does optimized for biochar only (not heat energy)
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1761745824070_0.png)
	- we need a two purpose stove: biochar + heat
		- foundation: https://batchrocket.eu/en/
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1761745856659_0.png)
		- the problem is still unsolved!
- ## Carbon negativity
  collapsed:: true
	- biochar is the only technology to slow down
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1761745079029_0.png)
	- reforestation is amazing, but it is too slow
	- biochar have positive feedback loop
	  collapsed:: true
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1761745366908_0.png)
	- biochar - the tech we missed
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1761745327152_0.png)
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1761745570586_0.png)
	- biochar fusion is the future! ;-)

- ## Changing the culture
  collapsed:: true
	- ## http://burn.city
	- global alternative to burning man every niepi on Bali
	- the culture of burning not ashes, but to biochar
	- next 1 week before 19 march
