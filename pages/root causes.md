# The 10 Root Causes Framework
- ## A Simplified Model of Human Disease
  
  The modern medical classification system contains 55,000+ disease codes. This complexity obscures a simpler truth: nearly all human illness traces back to approximately 10 root causes. Understanding these causes — and their simple fixes — offers a clearer path to health than memorizing thousands of disease names.

- Adequate vitamin D (immune modulation)
- Manage stress (cortisol suppresses immunity)
- Avoid unnecessary immune challenges
- Sleep (immune system repairs during sleep)
- Identify and remove personal triggers (food sensitivities, environmental)
  
  ---
- ## 4. TOXIC EXPOSURE
  
  **What it is:** Accumulation of harmful substances that damage cells, disrupt signaling, or cause mutations.
  
  **What it causes downstream:**
- DNA damage → cancer

- Omega-3 fatty acids (inflammation, brain)
- Iodine (thyroid)
- Zinc (immune, wound healing)
  
  **Simple fixes:**
- Eat whole foods, diverse colors
- Prioritize nutrient density over calories
- Consider testing for common deficiencies
- Targeted supplementation where needed (D, B12, Mg, omega-3)
- Address absorption issues (gut health)
- Reduce nutrient-depleting substances (alcohol, sugar, certain medications)

  **What it causes downstream:**
- Acute tissue damage
- Chronic pain syndromes
- Scar tissue and adhesions

- ## 7. GENETIC ERROR
  
  **What it is:** Inherited or spontaneous mutations that disrupt normal cellular function.
  
  **What it causes downstream:**
- Single-gene disorders (cystic fibrosis, sickle cell, etc.)
- Increased disease susceptibility
- Metabolic disorders
- Cancer predisposition
- Developmental abnormalities
- Premature aging syndromes
  
  **Reality check:** Only ~5-8% of disease is purely genetic. Most "genetic risk" requires environmental triggers.
  
  **Simple fixes:**
- Know your family history
- Genetic testing for high-risk conditions
- Epigenetic optimization (lifestyle modifies gene expression)
- Avoid triggers for genetic predispositions (e.g., smoking with lung cancer genes)
- Early screening for familial conditions
- Accept what cannot be changed; control what can be

- ## 8. PSYCHO-NEURO STRESS
  
  **What it is:** Chronic activation of stress pathways — psychological trauma, anxiety, depression, unresolved emotional patterns.
  
  **What it causes downstream:**
- Elevated cortisol → immune suppression, metabolic disruption
- Chronic inflammation
- Cardiovascular disease
- Gut dysfunction (gut-brain axis)
- Accelerated aging
- Sleep disruption
- Behavioral cascades (poor eating, substance use, isolation)
- Pain amplification
  
  **Simple fixes:**

- Dark, cool, quiet sleep environment
- Morning light exposure
- No screens 1-2 hours before bed
- Limit caffeine (none after noon for many)
- Limit alcohol (disrupts sleep architecture)
- Address sleep apnea if present
- Wind-down routine
  
  ---
- ## 10. DEGENERATION / AGING
  
  **What it is:** Accumulated cellular damage, telomere shortening, stem cell exhaustion, loss of repair capacity.
  
  **What it causes downstream:**
- Tissue weakness and failure
- Reduced regeneration
- Sarcopenia (muscle loss)
- Cognitive decline
- Sensory loss
- Increased vulnerability to all other causes
  
  **Simple fixes (slow the rate):**

- ## THE INTERACTION MODEL
  
  These causes rarely act alone. Most chronic disease involves multiple interacting causes:
  
  **Example: Type 2 Diabetes**
- Metabolic imbalance (primary)
- Nutrient deficiency (magnesium, chromium)
- Psycho-neuro stress (cortisol → blood sugar)
- Sleep disruption (insulin resistance)
- Toxic exposure (certain pollutants)
- Genetic susceptibility (modifier)
  
  **Example: Heart Disease**
- Metabolic imbalance (lipids, glucose)
- Immune dysregulation (inflammation)
- Psycho-neuro stress (cortisol, blood pressure)
- Toxic exposure (smoking, pollution)
- Nutrient deficiency (omega-3, magnesium)
- Sleep disruption
  
  **Example: Cancer**
- Toxic exposure (carcinogens, radiation)
- Infection (viral oncogenesis)
- Immune dysregulation (surveillance failure)
- Metabolic imbalance (growth signaling)
- Genetic error (mutations)
- Chronic inflammation (tissue damage)

- ## THE SIMPLE PROTOCOL
  
  If addressing all 10 feels overwhelming, these 5 interventions impact multiple causes simultaneously:
- **Move daily** → metabolic, immune, psycho-neuro, sleep, degeneration
- **Eat whole foods** → metabolic, nutrient, immune, toxic
- **Sleep 7-9 hours** → immune, metabolic, psycho-neuro, degeneration
- **Manage stress** → psycho-neuro, immune, metabolic, sleep
- **Avoid toxins** (alcohol, tobacco, processed food, pollution) → toxic, metabolic, immune
  
  These five actions address 80%+ of modifiable disease risk.

- ## CONCLUSION
  
  Modern medicine has created 55,000+ disease codes, but nearly all trace back to 10 root causes. Rather than treating downstream symptoms with 10,000+ pharmaceutical interventions, addressing root causes prevents the cascade before it starts.
  
  The human body has remarkable repair capacity when causes of damage are removed. Most chronic disease is not inevitable — it's the predictable result of cause accumulation over time.
  
  **The framework:**
- 10 causes
- 15 core symptoms
- 10 body systems
  
  **= ~1,500 meaningful combinations instead of 55,000 arbitrary disease names.**
  
  Simple. Actionable. Effective.
