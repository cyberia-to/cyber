- TODO lecture at [[bootcamp/v0]]
- we are obsessed with the idea of fast, cheap and lowtech construction
- typical development of housing takes 2-3 years
- it is too slow for a such dynamic world
- our goal is to provide full self sustainable package in the range of $10k - $100k
	- land
	- equipment
	- materials
	-
- our idea is to grow settlement using two parallel construction flows
	- camping
	- settlement
-
- such constructions can be durable enough for comfortable living
	- can sustain for 3-5 years
	- can be constructed in weeks and cost $10k - $20k
	- including furniture, electronics and autonomy equipment
	- most of these costs can be transplanted to capital construction
- if you find a way to settle its way faster to build something cheaper and faster
- follow us to get updates and reports on the effort
