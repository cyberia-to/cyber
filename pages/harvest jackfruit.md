- harvest on the growing moon
- during harvest
	- check the health of the tree
	- check soil acidity - if less then 7.0 add limestone to the soil
	- remove allelopathy and grass 3-4 meters around the trunk
	- apply to the most weak trees
- # weekly jackfruit care checklist (*artocarpus heterophyllus*)
- [ ] moisture check:
	- feel top 3–5 cm soil; if dry → deep-water to the dripline
		- • young trees: ~10–20
		- • mature: ~30–60
		- • no puddling >1 h
- [ ] drainage pass (after rain):
	- open channels;
	- keep root collar dry/exposed.
- [ ] mulch:
	- maintain 5–10 cm organic mulch;
	- pull back 10–15 cm from trunk.
- [ ] weed-free ring:
	- keep a clean 60–100 cm circle;
	- no tools scraping bark.
- [ ] canopy & sanitation:
	- remove dead/diseased/crossing twigs;
	- lift branches touching soil;
	- avoid hard pruning in one go.
- [ ] training (young trees):
	- guide 3–4 strong scaffold branches;
	- remove water sprouts and suckers.
- [ ] flowers & fruit set:
	- note male (slender, fuzzy) vs female (rounder, firm) heads;
	- on still/humid mornings you may hand-dust pollen from male to female to boost set.
- [ ] fruit management:
	- thin crowded young fruits (aim ≈1 fruit per 30–45 cm of branch);
	- bag fruits with breathable sacks; sling/support heavy fruit clusters.
- [ ] pests:
	- check peduncles/undersides for mealybugs, scale, mites, borers;
	- manage ants.
	- action → morning rinse + soap 1–2% or neem 5 ml/l; repeat in 3–5 days if needed; discard badly infested fruit.
- [ ] disease watch:
	- leaf/fruit spots or sooty mold → remove affected parts, improve airflow;
	- optional spray baking soda 1 tsp/l + drop of soap (avoid evening wetting).
- [ ] feeding (if it’s a feed week):
	- compost tea/vermicompost extract 4–8 l/tree; keep n moderate;
	- add a light potassium boost (seaweed/wood ash sprinkled thinly, then water in).
- [ ] micronutrients note:
	- • interveinal yellowing on older leaves → magnesium (plan epsom 1–2 g/l next feed)
	- • small rosetted leaves → zinc (plan seaweed/trace foliar next week)
- [ ] ground hygiene:
	- collect and bin fallen fruit/leaves;
	- keep trunk area dry.
- [ ] stake/ties (young trees):
	- check and loosen to prevent girdling;
	- protect from wind rock.
- [ ] log it:
	- date, rainfall, liters watered, feed (y/n), pests/disease seen, # fruits set, # fruits bagged/supported.
