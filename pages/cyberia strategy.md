- The business model compounds value across daily, weekly, and monthly experiences
- The implementation enable indirect monetizing land rights and leaseholds through a tokenized global gateway: a non profit DAO in MRI holding blocking package in the Indonesian for profit PT PMA company which acquired HGB rights and operating in a strict compliance with Indonesian bylaws.

	- investor pitch
	- strategy stack
	- operational playbook
	- capital plan
	- and phased product roadmap
- ## pitch
	- problem (focused)
		- rentals are fragmented, short‑term, and low‑margin
		- infrastructure, food, and events are externalized → cost leakage and lost revenue
		- construction is slow, expensive, and unsustainable → limits scalability
	- solution (cyberia advantage)
		- full‑circle rent model (daily → weekly → monthly) on a global platform → higher margins and retention
		- integrated ecosystem: events, food production, and local infra → capture revenue, reduce costs
		- modular, fast, sustainable construction → scalable growth with lower capex
	- market opportunity
		- bali and southeast asia attract nomads, wellness travelers, and festival culture; demand for autonomous, sustainable communities is rising globally
		- cyberia sits at the intersection of real estate, events, food, infra, and culture, addressing multiple spends per guest across time horizons
	- product roadmap (daily → weekly → monthly)
		- phase 1: hiking center with tickets, food, spa, glow forest, pilot glamping
		- phase 2: event space for weekly organizers, retreats, weddings, and markets
		- phase 3: nomad hub for monthly memberships across coliving, coworking, and wellness
		- anchor: burn.city yearly festival for global brand gravity
	- economics and revenue stack
		- revenue: rent, events, f&b and wellness, infra services, construction services/licensing, land rights monetization (hgb), district and micro‑leaseholds
		- margin stack: each pillar internalizes spend and compresses opex while increasing pricing power
	- moat
		- five fundamentals working as one system; tokenized participation; cultural anchor; vertical food and infra; modular construction speed
	- go‑to‑market
		- daily visitors → weekly organizers → monthly residents; partnerships with farmers (nandu), wellness brands, event producers, and tech collectives
	- the ask (to tailor later with numbers)
		- raise via offshore tokenized vehicle and pt pma equity; uses: infra, modular builds, event platform, nandu ramp, festival prep; investor exposure to yield and land‑backed upside
- ## strategy stack: the five pillars
	- land model innovation
		- buy cheap and beautiful remote land => build fast: months not years
		- global payment as ethereum L2 with instant cross border settlement
		- compliance with local laws: instant swap into local currency => full taxation
		- full‑circle real estate: daily → weekly → monthly → yearly → ownership
	- events integration
		- global event platform
		- rent yields $100 per room per day => with yoga class $200 per room per day
		- the app that earns extra for venues and event organizers => 10% go to plaftorm
		- + yearly anchor festival: burn.city
	- food production system
		- land is productive, not decorative: $300 per room yoga with food
		- [[nandu grow]] program: farmer incubator with efficient farming guidelines
		- local market with direct supply to restaurant, spa, and health venues
	- infrastructure sovereignty
		- energy is not the cost but earn yield for residents and operators
		- water is collected, filtered and recycled: drinking water right from the shower
		- data
		- , and software locally; microgrid, water capture/treatment, local data stack → cost control and resilience
	- construction model
		- cool, fast, cheap builds: one floor, low density, natural materials (teak, bamboo, local wood, clay, pozzolan, stone), modular and prefab on site
