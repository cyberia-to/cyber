- ....if an environmental variable (such as temperature)
  or an input or output variable (such as the flow demand on a
  system) changes and the system can nearly compensate for those
  changes in some other variable (such as outlet pressure) then the
  system is said to be regulated or regulated for that variable.
  If the regulation is obtained by a static compensation in which
  some linkage or component is introduced that diminishes the
  sensitivity to change, then this is static regulation (e.g., a
  spring scale is designed with materials that thermally compensate
  the spring against temperature change; a dc motor is designed by
  the choice of its field windings to give a speed regulation
  against changes in the load put on the motor; a chemical buffer
  shifts the operating point of chemical equilibrium to hold the pH
  of a solution constant). In dynamic regulation, two different
  switch states (an "on" and an "off" state) are arranged so that
  the system switches from one state to the other when the
  regulated parameter rises to an upper limit (an on-off
  thermostat).  In feedback regulation (or control as it is
  technically referred to), an error signal is produced between the
  existing state of a system and the desired regulated level.  This
  error signal is operationally acted upon, amplified in power, and
  fed to an actuator to operate a network which can influence the
  regulated variable so as to reduce the error, e.g., in biology
  the Na+ angiotension system.  The signal is the sodium
  concentration.  When this concentration decreases, aldosterone is
  liberated from the adrenal cortex.  This agent acts on the kidney
  distal cubules to increase the reabsorption of sodium ions and
  re-establish the proper concentration of sodium.  (Iberall) (2) a
  notion valid in the domain of description of heteropoiesis, that
  reflects the simultaneous observation and description made  by
  the designer (or its equivalent) of interdependent transitions
  of the system that occur in a specified order and at specified
  speeds. (Maturana and Varela, 1979) REGULATOR....a system which
  determines (selects) and enforces (maintains) the operating
  parameters of another system.  The regulator may or may not be a
  subsystem of the system being regulated.  (Umpleby)
