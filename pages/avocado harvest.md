- # weekly avocado care checklist (tropics-friendly)
- **moisture check:**
	- feel top 3–5 cm soil; if dry → deep-water to the **dripline**
	  • young trees: ~10–15 l
	- • mature: ~20–40 l
	- • avoid puddling >1 h
- **drainage pass (after rain):**
	- open channels;
	- keep root collar dry/exposed.
- **mulch:**
	- maintain 5–10 cm organic mulch;
	- pull back **10–15 cm from trunk**.
- **weed-free ring:**
	- keep a clean 60–100 cm circle;
	- no tools scraping bark.
- **canopy & sanitation:**
	- remove dead/crossing twigs, water sprouts, soil-touching branches;
	- no hard pruning.
- **stake/support (young trees):**
	- check ties;
	- prevent wind rock.
- **flowers & fruit:**
	- in bloom, avoid spraying;
	- watch pollinators.
	- thin heavy sets on young trees;
	- prop heavy limbs;
	- pick up fallen fruit.
- **feeding (if it’s a feed week):**
	- compost tea/vermicompost extract **2–4 l/tree**;
	- keep N moderate;
	- add a light **potassium** source (seaweed/wood ash) if fruiting.
- **micronutrient watch:**
	- • pale new leaves → iron issue
	- • older leaves yellow w/ green veins → magnesium
	- plan next-week fix (chelate/epsom), avoid leaf burn salts.
- **pests:**
	- check undersides for mites, thrips, scale, leaf miner;
		- manage ants.
		- action → morning rinse + **soap 1–2%** or **neem 5 ml/l**;
		- repeat in 3–5 days if needed.
- **disease watch:**
	- black leaf/fruit spots (anthracnose) or sooty mold → remove affected leaves, improve airflow;
	- optional spray **baking soda 1 tsp/l + drop of soap** (not in evening).
	- watch for root-rot signs (wilt/dieback) → improve drainage immediately.
- **ground hygiene:**
	- clear litter from under canopy;
	- keep trunk area dry.
- **container extras (if potted):**
	- rotate 90° for even light;
	- ensure pot feet/air gap;
	- deep-flush salts once/month.
- **log it:**
	- date, rainfall, liters watered, feed (y/n), pests/disease seen, fruit drop count.
