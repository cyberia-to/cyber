tags:: operation

- its currently the biggest bottleneck in construction
- its heavy, we need it a lot, we need it everywhere
- on average electric bike spend 3-4 % of battery to climb 100m by height
- we can charge reliably in a very short window: from 10.00 to 14.00
- so the process is the following
	- responsible for operation must install motorbike on charging at 10.00
	- in 14.00 he must start delivery
		- register % of charging
	- once the bettery is drained the bike must be returned to charger
		- not connect to charger until next morning, energy at night is limited
		- work done must be registered and remaining power, if its there
- never stop this process
