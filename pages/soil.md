- ### soil fertility assessment
	- physical characteristics of the soil
		- texture and water content
			- predominantly sandy, classified as loamy sand, sandy clay loam, and sandy loam.
			- low water-holding capacity, with low water content at both field capacity and the permanent wilting point.
		- ph and electric conductivity
			- ph levels range from slightly acidic to neutral.
			- very low electric conductivity, indicating low availability of soluble salts.
		- nutrient content and soil health
			- organic carbon and nutrients
			- high percentage of organic carbon (5.46% at coffee site), indicating fertile soil.
			- medium to low levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
		- micro-nutrients and heavy metals
			- high quantities of aluminum, calcium, and iron, possibly from natural or anthropogenic sources.
			- presence of heavy metals like lead and mercury suggests contamination from human activities.

- recommendations
	- incorporating organic matter like mature compost can improve soil structure and nutrient retention.
	- planting nitrogen-fixing crops will help replenish soil nitrogen levels naturally.
	- regular soil testing is recommended to monitor nutrient levels and prevent contamination.
- conclusion
	- proper management practices can enhance soil productivity in cyber valley, supporting diverse agricultural activities while preserving environmental health.
