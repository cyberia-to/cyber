- abolitionist project and biotechnology: the text outlines how biotechnology could abolish suffering throughout the living world, leading to a future where our descendants experience genetically preprogrammed well-being far richer than today's peak experiences
- technical feasibility: it is technically feasible to abolish the biological substrates of any unpleasant experience. this includes psychological and physical pain, through advancements like wireheading, utopian designer drugs, and genetic engineering
- moral urgency: the text argues for the moral urgency of the abolitionist project, emphasizing that alleviating suffering is an ethical imperative, regardless of one's ethical framework
- revolution in biotechnology: the text posits that a [[revolution]] in biotechnology will eventually lead to the abolition of suffering, though not as quickly as desired. it highlights the potential of genetic engineering to create a future with adaptive gradients of well-being
- [[designer babies]]: the text discusses the impending reproductive revolution of designer babies, where genetic engineering will enable parents to select traits for their children, potentially leading to a society with higher hedonic set-points
- non-human animal suffering: the text expands the abolitionist project to non-human animals, advocating for a future where biotechnology eliminates suffering in all sentient beings, including those in nature and factory farming
- future without [[suffering]]: the text envisions a future where intelligent agents use cross-species depot-contraception and genetic engineering to eliminate suffering across the natural world, including in marine ecosystems
- principle of weak benevolence: the text suggests that even if future generations are only weakly benevolent, the reduction of suffering could be achieved if the sacrifice involved is made non-existent or trivial
- these parts collectively present a vision of a future where suffering is not only technically preventable but also an ethical priority, made possible through advanced [[biotech]] and genetic engineering
