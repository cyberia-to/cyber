- omega-3 fatty acids are essential fats that plays a crucial role in maintaining
	- [[cardiovascular health]]
	- [[reducing inflammation]]
	- [[supporting neurological function]]
	- [[increasing longevity]]
- because the human body cannot produce enough omega-3 on its own, they must be obtained from diet or supplementation
- ## types of omega-3
	- [[alpha-linolenic acid]]
		- plant-derived
		- essential for human body, body cannot synthesize it
	- [[eicosapentaenoic acid]]
		- marine-derived, microalgae is the only practical source, fish eat microalgae to get epa
		- body can convert ~5% from [[ala]]
		- controls inflammation, blood clotting, vascular tone, mood regulation
	- [[docosahexaenoic acid]]
		- marine-derived, microalgae is the only practical source, fish eat microalgae to get dha
		- body can convert ~2% from [[ala]]
		- needed for brain, eyes, nervous system, sperm and embryo development
- ## chemical properties
	- solubility: insoluble in water; soluble in organic solvents and fats
	- structure: polyunsaturated chains with multiple cis double bonds
- ## therapeutic activity
	- [[cardiovascular health]]
		- reduces triglycerides by up to 30% and lowers risk of sudden cardiac death
		- regulating cholesterol
		- and reducing blood pressure
	- [[neuroprotection]] & [[mood regulation]]
		- supporting cognitive function and vision
		- reduced risk of depression, anxiety
		- protecting against age-related cognitive decline
	- [[longevity]]: higher blood omega-3 index is associated with living 4–5 years longer on average due to lower [[telomere shortening]]
	- [[anti-inflammatory]]
		- balances omega-6 intake and reduces risk of chronic inflammatory conditions: arthritis, metabolic syndrome
		- antimicrobial effects and inhibition of microbial biofilm formation
		- immune modulation against
			- bacteria
				- [[staphylococcus aureus]]
				- [[streptococcus pneumoniae]]
				- [[escherichia coli]]
			- fungi
				- [[candida albicans]]
			- viruses
				- [[influenza virus]]

- ## conclusion
	- for health and longevity, prioritize marine or algal sources of epa and dha, while using plant foods for ala. evolutionarily, our brains and eyes expanded in coastal and riverine environments where fish and shellfish provided a steady stream of these epa/dha fats. so epa/dha from plankton → small fish → larger fish → humans, shaped our cognitive evolution and longevity.
	- eating 2–3 servings of fatty fish per week, or taking high-quality algal/fish oil supplements, ensures optimal intake
	- omega-3 are not just nutrients — they’re long-term investments in vitality, resilience, and extended healthy lifespan
