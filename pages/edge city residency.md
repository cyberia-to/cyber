alias:: pirates of cyber states

- the residency is dedicated to the creation of [[cyberia]]
- > permissionless countries. greenfield villages. edge tech for real territory.
- Join builders, hackers, and homesteaders who treat statecraft like open-source. across two weeks we swap field-tested tactics for founding autonomous villages, wire up energy and water, design resilient biomes, harden personal security, and prototype governance. bring your curiosity, a mask for halloween, and good boots for the morning hikes.
- ## Why this course
	- creation of new countries is a permissionless phenomenon
	- we share lived experience from building a greenfield autonomous village
	- we touch edge tech because it multiplies terrain—privacy, cryptography, ai, and token engineering
	- you leave with playbooks, allies, and momentum
- ## Who this is for
	- founders of villages, co-ops, zones, and network states
	- permaculture, energy, and water tinkerers
	- cryptography and governance nerds
	- anyone ready to turn land into livelihood and culture
- ## What you’ll do
	- learn by stories, blueprints, and hands-on workshops
	- set up secure comms and private money flows
	- hike every morning to pattern-match terrain and water
- ## Tone and vibe
	- practical over performative
	- open source, low ego, high agency
- ## Call to action
	- apply, pack layers, bring a notebook, arrive on time
