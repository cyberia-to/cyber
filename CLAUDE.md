# Claude Code Instructions

## Git Workflow

- **Commit by default.** After completing a change, commit it. Don't wait
  for the user to say "commit". Only stage without committing when the user
  explicitly asks to stage.
- **Atomic commits.** One logical change per commit. Never combine two
  independent features, fixes, or refactors in a single commit. If you
  made two separate changes, make two separate commits. Don't commit
  half-finished work either — if unsure whether the change is complete,
  ask before committing.
- **Conventional commits.** Use prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`,
  `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`.

## Writing Style

- **Never define by negation.** Do not write "this is not X" or "not a Y
  but a Z". Say what something IS. Negation is a crutch — state the
  positive identity directly.

## License

Cyber License: Don't trust. Don't fear. Don't beg.
