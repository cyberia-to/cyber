# Architecture

[[cyb]] is a sovereign browser that becomes an operating system. identity is a keypair, state lives on-chain, [[smart contracts]] run locally, and the entire render stack compiles to GPU. one binary, all platforms, 130K lines of [[Rust]], no WebView, no V8, no Google.

cyb/os is a stack of typed universes — fourteen computation [[cyb/languages]] compiled through one structural IR, rendered through nine perception primitives, driven by ten decision primitives — all sharing one toolchain, one tree substrate, and one [[proof]] system. see [[cyb/languages]] for the algebraic completeness argument and [[cyb/multiproof]] for the proving design.

core stack: [[radio]] for data publishing, [[cyber]] for search and [[learning]], [[rune]] for orchestration ([[Rs]] on [[Nox]] with host jets — ms-start, async, dynamic, with native access to WASM, GPU, and ONNX), [[CozoDB]] graph storage, [[cosmos-sdk]] chains via [[IBC]]. builds for [[web]], [[desktop]], [[mobile]].

## Part I: The Three Grids

the operating system is the membrane between three grids

```
COMPUTATION (what the machine thinks)     PERCEPTION (what the human sees)
─────────────────────────────────         ────────────────────────────────
Nox    → trees                            struct    → collapsible tree
Bt     → bits                             pixels    → raster image
Rs     → words                            text      → prose, code
Trident→ fields                           formula   → math notation
Arc    → graphs                           vector    → SVG, paths, curves
Seq    → events                           video     → moving pixels
Inf    → relations                        table     → 2D grid
Wav    → signals                          sound     → audio waveform
Ten    → tensors                          component → nested composition

DECISION (what the human does)
──────────────────────────────
observe   → gather without choosing
filter    → narrow by criteria
select    → choose one from many
rank      → order by preference
compose   → build a new value
split     → one becomes many
merge     → many become one
delegate  → route to another agent
reject    → explicitly not-choose
confirm   → irreversible commit
```

every computation type has a canonical rendering. a tree computed in [[Nox]] naturally displays as a collapsible `struct`. a graph traversed in [[Arc]] naturally draws as `vector` paths. a relation queried in [[Inf]] naturally fills a `table`. a signal processed in [[Wav]] naturally plays as `sound`. the mapping is many-to-many, but the canonical pairing is the path of least impedance — where the shape of the data matches the shape of the display.

every rendering invites a decision. the human responds with typed decision primitives — select, rank, compose, confirm — each with its own algebra, its own temporal mode, and its own relationship to the computation and perception grids.

### 1. Fourteen Computation Languages

every language has a short name (2-3 letters, used in code) and a long name (used in prose):

```
Universe          Short  Long           Type        Algebra           Purpose
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Structure         Nox    Nox            Tree        Combinators       Composition
Binary            Bt     Bitwise        Bit         𝔽₂ tower          Circuits
Byte              Rs     Rustic         Word        Bitwise on 𝔽ₚ     Systems
Field             Tri    Trident        Field       Arithmetic on 𝔽ₚ  Proofs
Topology          Arc    Arc            Graph       Adjacency         Knowledge
Geometry          Ren    Render      Shape       G(p,q,r)          Space
Curvature         Dif    Differential   Manifold    (M, g)            Meaning
Dynamics          Sym    Symplectic     Phase       (M, ω), dω = 0   Physics
Belief            Bel    Belief         Distrib.    g on Δⁿ           Self-model
Causality         Seq    Sequence       Event       Partial order     Ordering
Inference         Inf    Infer          Relation    Unification       Reasoning
Continuum         Wav    Wave           Signal      Convolution       Sensing
Linear            Ten    Tensor         Tensor      Contraction       Learning
Resource          Tok    Token          UTXO        Conservation      Economy
```

a data type deserves its own language when its algebraic laws are so different from other types that forcing it into a foreign language creates constant impedance mismatch. fourteen fundamental types pass this test. each inhabits a universe defined by its characteristic algebraic structure. some universes share a proof system. some share a compiler. none share semantics. see [[cyb/languages]] for the full completeness argument and irreducibility proof.

### 2. The Value Tower — Three Modes of Reference

Byte and Field share the same mathematical substrate — the [[Goldilocks field]] 𝔽ₚ where p = 2⁶⁴ − 2³² + 1. this substrate provides three atom types sufficient for twelve of the fourteen universes.

| Tag  | Name    | Representation      | Valid Range   | Use        |
|------|---------|---------------------|---------------|------------|
| 0x00 | `field` | Single 𝔽ₚ element   | [0, p)        | Arithmetic |
| 0x01 | `word`  | Single 𝔽ₚ element   | [0, 2⁶⁴)     | Bitwise    |
| 0x02 | `hash`  | 4 × 𝔽ₚ elements     | 256-bit digest| Identity   |

three fundamentally different ways to refer to a value — and there are only three:

```
field = the value IS the reference     (by content — immediate)
word  = position IS the reference      (by location — index)
hash  = name IS the reference          (by commitment — identity)
```

by what it is. by where it is. by what it is called. every reference in any system reduces to one of these three modes.

every higher type decomposes into structure ([[Nox]] trees) over these three atoms:

```
Edge    = cons(source_hash, cons(target_hash, weight_field))
Event   = cons(event_hash, sequence_word)
Fact    = cons(relation_hash, cons(subject_hash, object_hash))
Sample  = field (amplitude value)
Tensor  = [field; N] (array of values with shape metadata)
```

three atoms are complete — for one characteristic. the single exception is Bt (Bitwise): a bit is genuinely not an element of 𝔽ₚ. it lives in 𝔽₂ — different characteristic, different algebra. that is exactly why Bt has a separate proof system, not just a new type tag.

```
Nox value tower (3 atoms: field, word, hash)
  sufficient for: Rs, Tri, Arc, Ren, Dif, Sym, Bel, Seq, Inf, Wav, Ten, Tok
  NOT sufficient for: Bt

Bt value tower (separate, 𝔽₂)
  sufficient for: Bt only
```

### 3. The Fourteen Languages

each language has its own page with ops tables, use cases, and proof paths:

| # | Universe | Short | Long | Page |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Structure | Nox | Nox | [[Nox]] |
| 1 | Binary | Bt | Bitwise | [[Bt]] |
| 2 | Byte | Rs | Rustic | [[Rs]] |
| 3 | Field | Tri | Trident | [[Trident]] |
| 4 | Topology | Arc | Arc | [[Arc]] |
| 5 | Geometry | Ren | Render | [[Ren]] |
| 6 | Curvature | Dif | Differential | [[Dif]] |
| 7 | Dynamics | Sym | Symplectic | [[Sym]] |
| 8 | Belief | Bel | Belief | [[Bel]] |
| 9 | Causality | Seq | Sequence | [[Seq]] |
| 10 | Inference | Inf | Infer | [[Inf]] |
| 11 | Continuum | Wav | Wave | [[Wav]] |
| 12 | Linear | Ten | Tensor | [[Ten]] |
| 13 | Resource | Tok | Token | [[Tok]] |

### 5. Nine Perception Primitives

the irreducible visual types — the atoms of everything a human can perceive through a screen and speakers. any UI, any document, any application is a composition of these nine. the four new computation languages (Ren, Dif, Sym, Bel) render through existing perception primitives: Ren → vector, Dif → vector, Sym → formula, Bel → formula.

| Primitive   | What it is                    | GPU mapping                          |
|-------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `text`      | Markdown, prose, code         | Glyphs via compute shader            |
| `struct`    | JSON, TOML — trees & configs  | Collapsible tree of text glyphs      |
| `table`     | 2D data, CSV                  | Grid of text cells, virtualized rows |
| `vector`    | SVG, paths, Bezier curves     | Path rasterization via Vello         |
| `pixels`    | Raster image                  | Texture upload, GPU sampler          |
| `video`     | Moving pixels                 | Hardware decode, texture per frame   |
| `sound`     | Waveform, audio stream        | Audio pipeline (visual: waveform shader) |
| `formula`   | LaTeX / MathML                | Glyph layout + vector curves via Vello |
| `component` | Composition of primitives     | Nested render pass                   |

`component` is to perception what `Nox` is to computation. Nox composes computations (cons, axis, branch). component composes renderings (nest, layout, pass).

### 6. Ten Decision Primitives

every human interaction with a computer is a decision. strip the physics away — what remains is pure decision structure.

| #  | Primitive | Action                | Reversible? | Time Mode | Comp Language | Perception |
|----|-----------|-----------------------|-------------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| 1  | observe   | Gather without choosing | Always    | Stream    | Wav           | any        |
| 2  | filter    | Narrow by criteria    | Yes         | Stack     | Inf           | struct     |
| 3  | select    | Choose one            | Yes         | Stream    | Inf           | table      |
| 4  | rank      | Order by preference   | Yes         | Stream    | Ten           | table      |
| 5  | compose   | Build new value       | Yes         | Stack     | Rs            | text/vector|
| 6  | split     | One becomes many      | Depends     | Heap      | Arc           | vector     |
| 7  | merge     | Many become one       | Depends     | Heap      | Arc + Inf     | vector     |
| 8  | delegate  | Route to agent        | Sometimes   | Heap      | Arc           | vector     |
| 9  | reject    | Explicitly not-choose | Mostly      | Stream    | Seq           | video      |
| 10 | confirm   | Irreversible commit   | Never       | Stack     | Trident       | formula    |

the machine computes, the human decides. computation produces options. perception displays them. decision collapses them to action. the action commits to new state, and the cycle continues.

confirm is the only primitive that is always irreversible. it is structurally unique — the moment where possibility collapses into fact. every other primitive can be undone, revised, or abandoned.

### 7. Cross-Grid Connections

the three grids interlock in a continuous decision loop — the cyb/os event loop:

```
loop {
  state   = nox_tree(current)           // authenticated tree
  options = compute(state)              // some universe produces alternatives
  display = render(options)             // canonical primitive shows them
  choice  = decide(human_input)         // decision primitive applied
  proof   = commit(choice, state)       // irreversible, potentially stark-proven
  state   = update(state, choice, proof)// new tree root
}
```

all three grids share one universal structural pair — fork and join:

```
            fork (one → many)          join (many → one)
            ─────────────────          ─────────────────
Computation  axis (decompose tree)      cons (build pair)
Perception   expand (drill into view)   nest (compose views)
Decision     split (divide choice)      merge (combine choices)
```

fork is how structure grows. join is how consensus forms. the same skeleton wearing three costumes.

## Build Order

### Phase 1 — Foundation (Now)

1. [[Nox]] — Define the 16-pattern structural IR with abstract Merkle authentication
2. [[Trident]] — Refine compiler and TIR
3. [[Rs]] — Strict [[Rust]] subset, same compiler backend as Trident, target Nox runtime

### Phase 2 — Expansion (Next)

4. [[Arc]] — Graph DSL for [[cybergraph]] programming. Compiles to Trident for proofs, native engine for queries.
5. [[Seq]] — Temporal logic for consensus rules and scheduling. Three temporal modes built in.
6. [[Inf]] — Datalog over the cybergraph. Rule-based inference turns explicit links into implicit knowledge.
7. [[Tok]] — Token conservation language. UTXO constraints compile to stark, native ledger engine for execution.

### Phase 3 — Specialization (When needed)

8. [[Bt]] — Binary circuits for legacy hash verification and cross-chain bridges.
9. [[Wav]] — Signal processing. Start as Rs library, promote to language if sensor workloads justify it.
10. [[Ten]] — Tensor operations. Start as Rs/Tri library, promote if ML inference verification becomes core.

### Phase 4 — Geometry (Research horizon)

11. Ren — Clifford geometric algebra. Engineering-ready, closest to Tri. Completes the Arc → SVG rendering pipeline.
12. Dif — Differential geometry. Riemannian manifolds over finite fields. Needed for [[tri-kernel]] formalization.
13. Sym — Symplectic geometry. Hamiltonian mechanics, [[conservation]] laws. Physics simulation.
14. Bel — Information geometry. Fisher metric on [[probability]] simplices. Self-model for [[superintelligence]].

see [[cyb/languages]] for the algebraic completeness argument. see [[cyb/multiproof]] for how all fourteen settle under one proving umbrella.

## The Thesis

cyb/os rests on three observations and one boundary.

one. every computational universe has a native type whose algebraic laws define how programs think. forcing computations across universe boundaries creates encoding overhead that scales with complexity. fourteen algebras → fourteen [[cyb/languages]].

two. every perceptual channel has a native format whose rendering laws define how humans see. forcing display across format boundaries creates visual noise. nine senses → nine primitives.

three. every human action is a decision with its own algebra: options, preferences, beliefs, commitments. ten decision types → ten interaction primitives.

the boundary. the machine computes, the human decides. computation produces options. perception displays them. decision collapses them to action. the action commits to new state, and the cycle continues.

all values in all universes (except Binary) decompose into three atoms — three modes of reference that are exhaustive:

```
field = the value IS the reference     (by content)
word  = position IS the reference      (by location)
hash  = name IS the reference          (by commitment)
```

these atoms compose through one structural substrate ([[Nox]], authenticated trees). they persist through three temporal modes (stack, heap, stream). they are present through one register — the singular now, the atom of attention where computation happens.

all three grids share one universal structural pair — fork and join — wearing three costumes:

```
Computation:  axis / cons      (decompose / build)
Perception:   expand / nest    (drill in / compose)
Decision:     split / merge    (diverge / converge)
```

fourteen languages. nine primitives. ten decisions. three atoms. three times. one fork. one join. one tree. one [[proof]]. one operating system.
